# Installing PocketFrame Alpha on macOS (Unsigned Build)

Because this alpha is unsigned/not notarized, macOS may block it initially.

## First launch
1. Open the DMG.
2. Drag `PocketFrame.app` to `Applications`.
3. In `Applications`, right-click `PocketFrame.app` and choose **Open**.
4. If blocked, click **Cancel** and continue below.

## Allow from Privacy & Security
1. Open **System Settings**.
2. Go to **Privacy & Security**.
3. Scroll to the security message for `PocketFrame`.
4. Click **Open Anyway**.
5. Confirm **Open** in the final prompt.

After this, future launches should be normal.

## Notes
- This bypass is expected for alpha unsigned apps.
- Do not install unsigned apps unless you trust the source.
